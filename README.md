# Hello World Service

## About Code Sample

In this sample, we will create a simple HelloWorld app that demonstrates how to create a webOS TV service. This sample
also demonstrates how to call the service from any web app and display the response. We will be using the command line
tool (CLI) of the webOS TV SDK to create the app and service, as well as packaging and installing the app on the target
device.

see [Getting Started](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/build-your-first-web-app).

## Do's and Don'ts

- **DO** match the base app ID with the service ID as in this example (com.sample.helloworld).

- **DO** test on the webOS TV devices or webOS TV Simulator.
